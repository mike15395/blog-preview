## My process

-Steps are as follows:
  -break the code in separate div's 
  -one div for holding image and all text below it
  -6 div's under it with flex column
  -center the main div
  -use percentage instead of px to make it responsive
  -apply css accordingly

### Built with

-HTML and CSS


### What I learned

My major learning is using percentages instead of px/rem/em to make it responsive without writing media queries.

By default web is responsive but we make it unresposive by hard coding width and height in px.

I also refined my knowledge about using flexbox to arrange elements as per design requirements.

### Continued development

I would continue to write more complex css with percentages and use flexbox as far as possible.
